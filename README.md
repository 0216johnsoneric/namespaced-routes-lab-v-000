## Outline

Back to the playlist example. This lab is going to be a bit beefier then the previous ones.

  * Implement a settings controller which is under a admin module
  * Settings should set sort order for songs and artist
  * Another controller called AccessControl which is under the admin module.
    * Turns off/on the ability to add artists or songs
  * It should actually work! The students will need to create a settings model to save all this in. The point of this lab is not the models, so not toooo much emphasis there.
